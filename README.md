**Deep Reinforcement Learning for Finance**

This project explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to financial processes. By simulating real-world financial scenarios, this framework aims to optimize decision-making in areas such as billing, taxation, client summaries, and partner performance analysis. 🌟📊🤖


**Ideology**

This project uses multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to tackle complex financial tasks by training agents to make intelligent decisions in dynamic environments: 🚀💡📈

Billing Optimization: Automating and enhancing payment processes.

Tax Strategy: Optimizing tax filings and compliance.

Client Insights: Summarizing client activities for actionable insights.

Partner Evaluation: Measuring and improving the performance of partnerships.

By employing RLlib and a shared simulation environment, agents collaboratively learn optimal strategies under realistic financial constraints. 🤝📘⚙️

**Getting Started**

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Environment:
Launch and interact with the shared environment by running shared_environment.py. 🌐🔧📂

Train Agents:
Train individual agents or the master agent using RLlib configurations provided in rllib_checkpoint.json. 🧠📊🛠️
